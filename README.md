# C# Kata 3: Arrays & Sorting (rehash)

###Without looking at yesterday’s code, complete all the steps from Kata #2, with the following changes:
 
1. Create a new dotnet application.
2. Open Program.cs and change the file’s namespace to Kata3.
3. Create a new file named Player.cs, which should contain a public class that takes a firstName, a lastName, and an int level in the constructor.
4. Set the constructor values to three public class properties.
5. Create a public method that returns the first and last name, and the player’s level, as a single string.
6. Create a new file named Leaderboard.cs, which should contain a public class with a method to add players to an array (must be an iterable of type Array!).
7. Create a public method within Leaderboard named PrintStats(). This method should print all players’ names and levels to the console. The output should be ordered by the players’ level property, showing the player with the highest level at the top of the board.
8. In the Program.cs main method, implement the Leaderboard class, add a few instances of Player, and print the player’s stats to the console.
9. The console message should also praise the winner and shame the loser (be creative here!).
